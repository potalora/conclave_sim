# Windsurf Conclave Simulation

## Background

On May 4, 2025, Pope Francis passed away, initiating the need for a conclave of 135 cardinal electors to choose his successor.

## Project Goal

Build a robust, transparent Monte Carlo simulation using Windsurf to forecast likely conclave outcomes and timelines under real-world rules and scenarios.

## Vision & Objectives

* **Vision:** Leverage an AI-native IDE to rapidly prototype, iterate, and maintain a conclave simulation engine that produces data-driven forecasts for an imminent papal election.
* **Objectives:**
  * Model the full multi-round, two-thirds-majority voting process among 135 electors.
  * Enable scenario analyses (e.g., shifting blocs, elector absences, rule variations).
  * Deliver clear visual and statistical outputs to inform analysts and stakeholders.
  * Maintain code quality and collaboration via Windsurfâ€™s AI features and CI/CD.
